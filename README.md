# Prometheus Installation Script for Raspbian

**Important:** This is a work in progress.

**Even more important:** Dont forget to change the config yaml after install.

This script downloads the files in the current directory. You could change this.

# How to Use This?

Whether you are using this to install individual components or the full app.
**Note that these scripts will add Prometheus and other utilities to systemd as services, and enable the by default**.

## Full Installation

Full installation will install the following:

* Prometheus
* Alertmanager
* Node Exporter
* Blackbox Exporter
* Grafana

Scripts have many `sudo`s, so before you start the full installation, do:

```bash
sudo pwd
```

just to make sure, `sudo` in scripts won't interrupt you. After that you can run script as:

```bash
./full_installation.sh
```

Or run script as a `root` user.

## Installation of Individual Components

Same rules apply as for the full installation before you try to execute other scripts:

```bash
sudo pwd
```

just to make sure, `sudo` in scripts won't interrupt you. And to install individual components, use:

* Prometheus: `./prometheus.sh`
* Alertmanager: `./alertmanager.sh`
* Node Exporter: `./node.sh`
* Blackbox Exporter: `./blackbox.sh`
* Grafana: `./grafana.sh`
